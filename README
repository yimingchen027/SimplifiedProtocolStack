Use 'make' to compile, and 'make clean' to delete object files.

ppp stands for process-per-protocol, ppm stands for process-per-message.

'./ppm' or './ppp' to run one host.

After run each host, type in the port number of the other host as printed on the screen.

Since we need to type the port number for each host, so each host start sending and receiving at different time.

We record the time each host sending the first message and receive the last message. 

So time from host 1 send its first message to host 2 receive the last message is endTime(host2)-startTime(host1)

After we measure the time, the performance of ppp and ppm is similar, almost the same, don't have much difference.
